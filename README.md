# Claude Code Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for coding in Claude Code, with a clear separation of concerns.

Subagents and skills are the most powerful features of Claude Code. However, they are frequently misused and lead to performance degradation or misbehavior due to their design flaws leading to high token usage.

These plugins are designed based on the [design principles](./DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) to achieve clear separation of concerns between agents and skills so that you can use them effectively.

## Getting Started

Launch Claude Code and run the following command:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add byunk/claude-code-toolkit
```

## Design Principles

[Design Principles](./DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you have ideas for plugin designs, feedback on existing agents, or suggestions for new workflows, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
